  abstract      = {Modal properties of dynamically tested wind turbine blades (WTBs) of a utility-scale wind turbine are identified. A comprehensive experimental program including free vibration and short- and long-term forced vibrations representing resonance and simplified fatigue conditions was carried out to investigate vibration-based features for damage diagnosis and prognosis. A set of 12 undamaged WTBs were tested to study the variability of the identified modal parameters. Results indicate that the variability of the natural frequencies was rather low, while the obtained damping ratios exhibited significant differences. Forced vibration tests were then conducted. To reach the failure of the blades, approximately 1.9 ×104 and 4.2 ×107 cycles were induced in the short- and long-term tests, respectively. Modal properties identified during testing protocols suggest that natural frequencies correlate well with damage. A linear finite element model was also developed, and its modal properties are compared to the identified modal parameters of the undamaged blades.},

  abstract   = {This paper reviews the recent literature on machine learning (ML) models that have been used for condition monitoring in wind turbines (e.g. blade fault detection or generator temperature monitoring). We classify these models by typical ML steps, including data sources, feature selection and extraction, model selection (classification, regression), validation and decision-making. Our findings show that most models use SCADA or simulated data, with almost two-thirds of methods using classification and the rest relying on regression. Neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees are most commonly used. We conclude with a discussion of the main areas for future work in this domain.},
